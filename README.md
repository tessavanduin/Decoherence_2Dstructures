# Decoherence_2Dstructures
Decoherence of two-dimensional spin structures coupled to an electron bath

This code consists of three files: ClassManager, Backend_ClassManager, Results.

In theory only the Results file is necessary to publish results.
The following results can be obtained for specified structures:
- Plot of the eigenvalues
- Contributions of different base states in eigenstates
- Plot the decay of exchange and dipolar coupling over distance
- Plot time evolution after spin flip

The code in the Result file is based on a class manager specified in the file ClassManager. The class manager has some supporting functions in Backend_ClassManager.
